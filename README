This little script will grab the Atom feed entries for a YouTube channel and sort them according to how "hot" they are, with old videos with a lot of views still staying pretty hot but also allowing cool new videos to rank highly. The ranking measure is borrowed from Hacker News' alleged ranking formula [1]. It is currently:

     rank = (view count - 1)/(age in days + 2)**1.5

At the moment all it does is spit out an HTML file as a console app. I might eventually convert it to a web app.
